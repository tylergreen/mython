= Changes since Release 1.51 = 

o Better README that actually documents the system.

o General bug fixes and code cleanup.

o Added scheme.MinimalInterpreter to allow masochists to play with a
  really minimal Scheme.

o Used weakref on symbols to prevent memory leak.

o Reduced the core interpreter by making LET and COND as
  expander-derived expressions.

o Cleaned up function names in pair.py from verbose names like
  pair.schemeCons to just pair.cons.

o Added AND and OR using an undocumented 'expander' module.

o Added EVAL and APPLY as core builtins.

o Variable length arguments work again.  Python supports variable
lengthed arguments with the star notation:

### [Python]
def sayHelloToFriends(*friends):
    for f in friends:
        print "hello", f
###



We can do something similar in PyScheme:

### [PyScheme]
(define (for-each f l)
   (if (null? l) 'ok
       (begin
          (f (car l))
             (for-each f (cdr l)))))

 (define (say-hello-to-friends . friends)
    (for-each (lambda (f) (display "hello ")
                          (display f)
                          (newline))
              friends))
###

For example:

###
[PyScheme] >>> (say-hello-to-friends 'danny 'jerry 'andy 'wendy 'tina)
hello danny
hello jerry
hello andy
hello wendy
hello tina
###


o Fixed tokenizer bug: parser.py didn't properly tokenize negative
  numbers.  That was dumb.
