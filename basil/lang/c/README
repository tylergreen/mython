Notes:

6/28/2003:

A good deal of the framework here was copied from some course website (the
URL of which I have misplaced) and then heavily modified. Credits in the
YACC grammar still hold (originated by Jeff Lee and obtained by way of
Jutta Degener).

The namespace stuff is not optimal and I'd love to rework it, or even
better still just drop in someone else's implementation.

Still left to do: Make this into a Python module.

7/2/2003:

Made this into a Python module and did some refactoring.  The Python module
is really rough around the edges, and I could stand to actually read the
distutils documentation.
