User story (Old way?)
=====================

#. User wishes to prototype language change.
#. User asseses and implements lexical, grammar and semantic differences.
    #. User has lexical changes
    #. Lexical changes impact token recognition only (no new tokens are added, but some semantic changes may then apply.).
    #. Lexical changes require introduction of new tokens (user must then modify grammar)
    #. Lexical changes cause alien attack.
    #. User has grammar changes (which should always cause semantic modification)
    #. User has semantic changes.

#. User adds tests
    #. Changes to language are backward compatible (i.e. old tests can be reused)
    #. Changes to language require changes to some or all old tests.

#. back to 2 until it works!

Another story
-------------

#. User writes code the way they want to and these become unit tests (for some parser).
    #. User is also kind enough to provide expected outputs (which become constraint inputs for the language semantics).

#. User uses some magic tool to infer needed language changes to some base language.
#. World peace breaks out.
